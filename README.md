# GameArchitecture
This repository contains descriptions of classes for game Warhammer 40000.
There are almost abstract classes here. If you want to create your own game race like "Space Marines","Imperial Guard", etc, firstly you have to extend classes "UnitGroup" and "GameBuilding" to make buildings and units relatively, and then you should add them to extended class "Race".
